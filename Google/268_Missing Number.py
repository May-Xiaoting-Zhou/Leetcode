# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity : O(n)

# Because the set allows for O(1) containment queries, the main loop
# runs in O(n) time. Creating num_set costs O(n) time, as each set insertion
# runs in amortized O(1) time, so the overall runtime is O(n+n)=O(n).

# Space complexity : O(n)

# nums contains nâˆ’1 distinct elements, so it costs O(n) space to
# store a set containing all of them.

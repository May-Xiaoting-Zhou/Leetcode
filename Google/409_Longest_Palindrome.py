# Complexity Analysis
# Let n be the length of the given string s.

# Time complexity: O(n)

# The algorithm goes through the characters of s twice: once to count their frequencies and once to construct the palindrome. Since hash table operations like inserting and updating take constant time (O(1)), the time complexity of the algorithm is O(2â‹…n), which simplifies to O(n).

# Space complexity: O(1)

# The algorithm uses a hash table to store the frequency of characters. Given that there can be at most 52 unique characters in s, the space complexity is O(52), which can be simplified to O(1) space.

# Complexity Analysis

# Let n be the side length of the grid.

# Time complexity: O(n ** 2)

# The algorithm makes two main passes. First, we iterate through each cell in our n√ón grid to build the frequency map, which takes O(n ** 2) operations. 
# Then, we iterate through numbers from 1 to n ** 2 to find our missing and repeated values, which takes O(n ** 2) operations. 

# Since both passes are sequential and take O(n ** 2) time, our overall time complexity is O(n ** 2).

# Space complexity: O(n ** 2)

# The algorithm uses a hash map to store the frequency of each number. The map will store all unique numbers from 1 to n ** 2 except the missing number, making the space complexity O(n ** 2).

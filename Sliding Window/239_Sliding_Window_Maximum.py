# Complexity Analysis
# Here n is the size of nums.

# Time complexity: O(n).

# At first glance, it may look like the time complexity of this algorithm should be O(n 
# 2
#  ), because there is a nested while loop inside the for loop. However, each element can only be added to the deque once, which means the deque is limited to n pushes. Every iteration of the while loop uses 1 pop, which means the while loop will not iterate more than n times in total, across all iterations of the for loop.
# An easier way to think about this is that in the worst case, every element will be pushed and popped once. This gives a time complexity of O(2â‹…n)=O(n).
# Space complexity: O(k).

# The size of the deque can grow a maximum up to a size of k
